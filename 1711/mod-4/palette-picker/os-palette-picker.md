Following functionalities are missing: 
1) can delete project and pallete from page, not yet on server
2) unspotted syntax error in test file, not passing or running properly

#### Which extensions, if any, did you complete?
N/A

# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/chunktooth/palette-picker/blob/9fbf47238dc81a69b614944507c3cdc1e886a0ca/public/script.js#L70)

Assigning variables from both fetches to return object key

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/chunktooth/palette-picker/blob/9fbf47238dc81a69b614944507c3cdc1e886a0ca/public/script.js#L106)

Grabbing a selector from the DOM element can be done in many ways and it can be tricky. Using $.map() selector and passing two arguments although makes sens, still seems odd.

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

#### Link to Design Inspiration

No link. I thought of static colored TV after staring at these color blocks for many times. The chosen color palette is to mimic a shelf of VHS cassettes.
